								My name is Michael Rizzo Smith and I am currently a first-year graduate student at Vanderbilt University in the Astrophysics PhD program. 
								I am originally from New Jersey and graduated from Stony Brook University in New York in May 2021 with a BS in Physics and Astronomy & Planetary Science.
								After graduation, I worked full-time at The Ohio State University for two years as a research technician and data analyst for the ASAS-SN group. At OSU I researched core-collapse supernovae with the Large Binocular Telescope.

								<b> Fun Fact:</b> I have a 4 year old husky named Kai that loves to go on adventures with me (pictured above)!
